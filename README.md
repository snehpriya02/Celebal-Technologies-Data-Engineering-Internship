# Celebal Data Engineering Internship Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my Celebal Data Engineering Internship repository! This repository chronicles my enriching journey as a Data Engineer intern at Celebal Technologies. Over the course of 8 weeks, from May 27th to July 25th, I had the opportunity to delve into various aspects of data engineering, honing my skills and collaborating with talented team members.

## Internship Journey

### Week 1-2: SQL Fundamentals

Under the guidance of mentors Udit Bhargava and Aman Agarwal, I mastered SQL fundamentals, learning to write complex queries and optimize performance.

### Week 3: Azure Data Factory (ADF)

With mentor Tanishka Kothari's guidance, I explored Azure Data Factory, creating data pipelines and understanding cloud-based data integration.

### Week 4: Data Warehousing

Mentors PALLAV PUROHIT and Tanishka Kothari introduced me to data warehousing, where I gained practical experience in designing and building robust data warehouse solutions.

### Week 5-6: Power BI

Under the mentorship of Tanishka Kothari, I delved into Power BI, transforming raw data into visually appealing dashboards and reports. 

### Week 7-8: Project Development

During the final 4 weeks, I collaborated with my team members to develop two Power BI dashboards:
- **Food and Beverages Dashboard:** Analyzing food and beverage data.
- **Sports Dashboard:** Analyzing IPL cricket team data.

## About the Power BI Dashboards

These dashboards were developed during the last 4 weeks of the internship. They provide comprehensive insights into food and beverage trends as well as IPL cricket team performance.

## Description of the Projects

Here, I documented my journey through data processing, analysis, and visualization during my internship at Celebal Technologies. My primary tools were Azure Data Factory, SQL, and Power BI.

Using Azure Data Factory, I orchestrated efficient data pipelines, starting from raw data ingestion to final transformation. These pipelines streamlined the processing of diverse datasets, ensuring they were ready for analysis. I optimized workflows, utilized various transformations, and maintained data integrity throughout the process.

Once the data was processed, I seamlessly integrated it into SQL databases. Leveraging SQL's power, I performed advanced queries to extract valuable insights and ensure data accuracy. These queries ranged from simple aggregations to complex joins and subqueries, enabling comprehensive analysis of the data.

To present these insights effectively, I turned to Power BI. Importing data directly from SQL databases, I designed interactive dashboards and reports. These visualizations provided stakeholders with intuitive access to key metrics and trends, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

Overall, this repository encapsulates my hands-on experience in data engineering at Celebal Technologies. From building data pipelines with Azure Data Factory to harnessing the analytical capabilities of SQL and crafting compelling visualizations with Power BI, each step contributed to my growth in the field.

Explore the code, pipelines, SQL queries, and Power BI dashboards contained within this repository to witness the practical application of data engineering concepts in a real-world setting. This journey showcases the transformative potential of data when effectively managed, analyzed, and visualized. Thank you for joining me on this adventure through the realm of data engineering."
